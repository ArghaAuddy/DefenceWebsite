        <p>The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is a premier research and development organization in India, functioning under the Ministry of Defence. Its primary objective is to undertake research and development of defence technologies and systems to strengthen India's defence capabilities. DRDO is engaged in a wide range of activities, including missile technology, aerospace, armaments, electronics, cyber security, naval systems, life sciences, and combat engineering. The organization has a vast network of laboratories and production facilities spread across the country, with over 50,000 scientists, engineers, and support staff working towards advancing India's defence technology base. DRDO's contributions to India's defence have been significant, with several indigenous systems and technologies developed and deployed by the Indian Armed Forces, including the Agni missile series, BrahMos cruise missile, Arjun tank, and Tejas fighter aircraft, among others, making India self-reliant in critical defence technologies and systems.

    <h4>A brief about the Origin and history of RAW agency Of India.</h4> 
    <p>
        The Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is India's premier external intelligence agency, established in 1968. Its primary mandate is to gather and analyze intelligence related to national security, counter-terrorism, and strategic threats to India. RAW operates covertly in over 60 countries, with a focus on collecting intelligence on potential adversaries, including Pakistan, China, and other neighboring countries. The agency's activities are highly classified, and its operations are shrouded in secrecy. RAW is known for its innovative and unconventional methods, including covert operations, cyber espionage, and psychological warfare. The agency's successes have been instrumental in thwarting terrorist attacks, preventing hostile activities, and protecting India's national interests.

    <h4>History.</h4>
    <p>
        Prior to the inception of the Research and Analysis Wing, overseas intelligence collection was primarily the responsibility of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which was created by the Government of India during British Raj. In 1933, sensing the political turmoil in the world which eventually led to the Second World War, the Intelligence Bureau's responsibilities were increased to include the collection of intelligence along India's borders.

    In 1947, after independence, Sanjeevi Pillai took over as the first Indian Director of the IB. Having been depleted of trained manpower by the exit of the British after Indian independence, Pillai tried to run the bureau on MI5 lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence operation, but the Indian debacle in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. Foreign intelligence failure during the 1962 Sino-Indian War led then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to order a dedicated foreign intelligence agency to be established.[3] After the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965, the Chief of Army Staff, General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, also called for more intelligence-gathering.[3][4] Around the end of 1966 the concept of a separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape.
    </p>
    <h4>Formation of R&AW  in 1968 to present.</h4>
    <p>The Indira Gandhi administration decided that a full-fledged second security service was needed. R. N. Kao, then a deputy director of the Intelligence Bureau, submitted a blueprint for the new agency.[10] Kao was appointed as the chief of India's first foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing.[11]: 259  The R&AW was given the responsibility for strategic external intelligence, human as well as technical, plus concurrent responsibility with the Directorate-General of Military Intelligence for tactical trans-border military intelligence up to a certain depth across the Line of control (LOC) and the international border.[3]

        From its inception R&AW has been criticised for being an agency not answerable to the people of India (R&AW reports to Prime Minister only). Fears arose that it could turn into the KGB of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R&AW's able leadership (although detractors of R&AW and especially the Janata Party have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during the 1975–1977 Emergency). The main controversy which has plagued R&AW in recent years is over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability,[12] inter-departmental rivalry, etc.[13][14][15][16] Noted security analyst and former Additional Secretary B. Raman has criticised the agency for its asymmetric growth; "while being strong in its capability for covert action it is weak in its capability for intelligence collection, analysis and assessment. Strong in low and medium-grade intelligence, weak in high-grade intelligence. Strong in technical intelligence, weak in human intelligence. Strong in collation, weak in analysis. Strong in investigation, weak in prevention. Strong in crisis management, weak in crisis prevention."[17]
        
        R&AW started as a wing of the main Intelligence Bureau with 250 employees and an annual budget of ₹2 crore. In the early seventies, its annual budget had risen to ₹30 crore while its personnel numbered several thousand. In 2007, the budget of R&AW is speculated to be as high as US$150 million[18][4] to as low as US$100 million.[19]</p>
